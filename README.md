A smart scalping bot for cTrader using Bollinger Bands, ATR-based risk management, and AI-driven price predictions (via LSTM integration placeholder).
This is an experimental trading robot designed to demonstrate how machine learning models can be integrated into algorithmic trading strategies.

🧠 Key Features
Bollinger Bands Strategy
Enters buy trades when price is at the lower band and LSTM predicts a rise, and sells when price hits the upper band with a bearish prediction.

LSTM Integration (Pluggable)
The bot includes a placeholder method (PredictNextPrice) to connect a trained LSTM model (e.g., in Python) for next price prediction.

Risk-Managed Trade Entries

Risk per trade configurable via percentage of account balance

Dynamic Stop Loss and Take Profit based on ATR volatility

Only one open position at a time to minimize risk

⚙️ Parameters
Parameter	Description	Default
BB Period	Period for Bollinger Bands	20
BB Deviation	Standard deviation for bands	2.0
Risk % Per Trade	% of balance to risk per trade	1.0
SL Multiplier	Multiplier for ATR-based Stop Loss	1.5
TP Multiplier	Multiplier for ATR-based Take Profit	2.5

🔍 How It Works
Bollinger Bands are used to identify potential entry zones (top and bottom).

The bot checks the LSTM model’s price prediction (mocked currently).

If prediction aligns with price hitting Bollinger Band extremes, it opens a trade.

Stop Loss and Take Profit are set dynamically based on ATR for better adaptation to volatility.

Only one trade is allowed at a time for better capital protection.

🧪 LSTM Integration
The PredictNextPrice() method currently returns a mocked predicted price.
To enable real AI predictions:

Train an LSTM model in Python using historical Forex data.

Export the model and run predictions via a local API or inter-process communication.

Replace the mock method with a real prediction call (e.g., HTTP request to Flask API).

🛠️ Example Entry Logic
csharp
Copy
Edit
if (predictedPrice > Bars.ClosePrices.Last(0) && Bars.ClosePrices.Last(0) <= _bb.Bottom.Last(0)) {
    OpenTrade(TradeType.Buy);
}
📌 Requirements
cTrader (cAlgo) platform

Access to compile and run custom cBots

Optional: Python environment for ML model predictions

⚠️ Disclaimer
This bot is for educational and experimental purposes only.
Trading Forex involves risk. Use this code at your own discretion and test thoroughly on demo accounts before deploying live.
